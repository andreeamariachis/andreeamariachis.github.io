                <p>In the last week of the project our team worked on the High-end Prototype and on the Stakeholder
                    document that contains all the work we did during this semester.

                <p> We can finally come to a conclusion for the research questions:</p>
                </p>


                <p><b> What are the needs of individuals with PPS?</b></p>
                <p>We answered this question using literature study and interview methods. We first did research to
                    understand what PPS is and how it affects people suffering with it, then conducted multiple
                    interviews to gain a deeper understanding of our target users paint points and needs.</p>


                <p>In conclusion, Persistent Physical Symptoms (PPS) is a complex condition with long-term physical
                    symptoms and no clear medical cause. People with PPS face challenges in their daily lives, including
                    discomfort and emotional distress, impacting relationships and work. Stress worsens PPS symptoms,
                    highlighting the need for a supportive and empathetic environment, social support, and professional
                    assistance to improve mental health and overall well-being.</p>

                <p><b>How can we design an interface that displays stress data in a non-judgmental way?</b></p>
                <p>To answer this question, we conducted literature study on the best practices for data visualization
                    and additionally we investigated new ways of visualizing data by looking at different industries:
                    energy consumption, air pilots, finance, and sport analytics.</p>
                <p>The interviews that we conducted with our target audience gave us insights on what are their needs,
                    what kind of data they want to see and how that data would look like when thinking about about
                    colours and types of graphs. Our goal was to create graphs that do not alarm the user and give/BPM
                    useful data in a quick way. We did this by making multiple prototypes where we used colors that were
                    alarming (red/yellow/green colors) and non-alarming (blue color) and presented the actual current
                    state of the Tension level, HRV/BPM and the sleep data so the user can make the assumptions
                    presented the actual current state of the Tension level, HRV/BPM and the sleep data so the user can
                    make the assumptions for themselves. Based on the results of the A/B testing, the prototypes where
                    we used non-alarming colors, which in this case was blue, was considered a preference because the
                    participant was able to make their judgements based on the graphs for themselves.</p>

                <p>Based on the results of the A/B testing, the prototypes in which we used non-alarming colors, in this
                    case blue, were considered a preference because the participants were able to make their own
                    decisions based on the graphs.</p>


                <p><b>How are we going to measure the user-friendliness in data visualizations?</b></p>

                <p>To answer this question, we measured user-friendliness in data visualization by conducting A/B
                    testing with our testers. The participants’ feedback provided valuable insights into their diverse
                    opinions and suggestions regarding different visualizations, including the overview page which
                    contains tension level, HRV/BPM and sleep displays, tension level with current states, tension level
                    with calendar and tension level with a weekly and a monthly view.</p>

                <p>Overall, the participants’ feedback underscored the importance of clarity, meaningful explanations,
                    intuitive design such as colour choices and indicators, and the provision of additional information
                    for better understanding of the data visualization. By incorporating these suggestions, we can
                    enhance the user experience and make the visualizations more informative and user-friendly, which
                    led to our final iteration.</p>

                <p><b>Main research question</b></p>
                <p>In conclusion, we have answered our main question, “How might we design a solution for individuals
                    with physical complaints that provides meaningful data collected from stress wearables in a
                    non-judgmental way?” through the exploration of three sub-questions.</p>

                <p>Through literature study on PPS and interviews with our target audience, we found individuals with
                    Persistent Physical Symptoms (PPS) face significant challenges due to long-term physical symptoms
                    without a clear medical explanation. Stress plays a significant role in worsening PPS symptoms,
                    emphasizing the need for a supportive and empathetic environment. By understanding the needs of
                    individuals with PPS, we can create a solution that helps them feel heard, validated and understood
                    in their journey towards managing their condition.</p>

                <p>Through literature study and exploration of data visualization practices in various industries, we
                    gained insights into best practices for presenting data in a user-friendly manner. We applied these
                    insights into our sketches and prototype. Testing with our target audience further informed our
                    design choices, such as using non-alarming colors and providing quick access to useful data. By
                    empowering users to interpret the data themselves, we can create an interface that avoids judgment
                    and promotes informed decision-making.</p>

                <p>Through A/B testing, we measured the user-friendliness of our data visualizations. Valuable feedback
                    from participants provided insights into their opinions and suggestions across various
                    visualizations. By incorporating the suggestions from A/B testing into our design, we can enhance
                    the user experience and make the visualization more informative.</p>

                <h2 id="future">Future Enhancements / Recommendations</h2>

                <p>These were feature preferences derived form out interviews that the target audience would like but
                    are outside of our scope:
                </p>

                <p>1. Integration with Spotify.</p>
                <p>2. AI-driven insights: Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyse stress patterns and provide
                    personalized insights and recommendations for stress management. </p>

                <p>3. Gamification elements: Incorporate gamification elements, such as achievements, rewards, or
                    challenges, to enhance user engagement and motivation.</p>

                <p>4. Expanded social support: Develop features for users to connect with a supportive community of
                    individuals with PPS, allowing for shared experiences and peer support.</p>

                <p>5. More detailed look into what is good and bad stress.</p>

                <p>To present to the stakeholder our work we created a document that contains all the phases that our
                    team went through with the assignment explanation, summaries and conclusions of each phase. All of
                    us contributed on this document:</p>
