                <p>After all of the interviews, competitor analysis, data visualization research and the user
                    requirements, the design phase started. The research phase helped us keep in mind these key features
                    and benefits when starting designing:</p>

                <p>Goal:This literature study's goal is to find out ways of displaying stress data taken from wearables
                    for patients with PPS (Persistent Physical Symptoms). This document contains UX principles and UI
                    design ideas that can help inspire our project.
                </p>

                <p>Each one of our team did a literature study on this topic. The following research was conducted by
                    me.</p>

                <p>At the beginning of our project, each team member created their own sketches inspired by the the
                    brainstorming session, ideas, requirements, and previous research. These sketches represented
                    individual visions of the concept’s appearance and functionality. By sharing our sketches and
                    gathering feedback, we engaged in collaborative brainstorming.</p>

                <p>These are the sketches that I created:</p>

                <p>Before starting to make the design I created a mood board to describe the feel of the envisioned
                    product. Since we wanted our product to be more sleek and dark themed I looked on websites like
                    Pinterest and Dribble to draw inspiration.

                <p>Based on all the sketches each one of us created different visions of how our stress tracker app

                <h2 id="1stPrototype">First Prototype</h2>
                <p><b>CMD Method: Prototyping</b> </p>
                <img src="Icons/logo-workshop.png" class="icon-method"> <br><br>


                <p>After reviewing the designs that each of us created, we decided to combine the best elements from
                    them into a single concept. Using the selected components, we created a basic prototype that can be
                    used in AB testing. We focused on key functionalities and user interactions while designing the
                    first prototype.</p>

            </li>


            <li class="approach">
                <h2 id="secondprototype">Second Prototype</h2>
                <p><b>CMD Method: Prototyping</b> </p>
                <img src="Icons/logo-workshop.png" class="icon-method"> <br><br>


                <p>By analysing the collected data and user responses from the A/B testing, we gained insights into what
                    worked well and what needed improvement. Using this feedback, we developed a second prototype that
                    addressed the identified issues and incorporated the suggested improvements.
                </p>

                <p><b>Features and pages</b></p>

                <p>In the end our last prototype consists of 7 pages. When the users open the app they will be shown
                    real time data of Tension level, HRV and Sleep analysis in the Overview page.

                    When users want to get more insights into their tension level they can press on it and go to the
                    Tension Page where they can see the lowest and highest tension level of the day and which activity
                    they did during those peaks of stress.

                    Swiping up will bring them to the Calendar Page where where they can see their tension level along
                    the day with time stamps and events added by the users themselves. This is one of the app’s way of
                    showing potential stressors to the users.</p>

                <p>When clicking on the Calendar Icon in the navigation menu, the monthly view page will appear. Here
                    users will get a heat map in the form of a calendar. Each day of the month will show their average
                    tension level. Another feature of the app is the Activities Insights which show the activities that
                    created the most tension for the user. </p>

                <p>If users want to see more information regarding a very high tension day they can press it and will be
                    given more in depth look at the tension levels of the day and which activities and events they went
                    through. Users can also pin events on the heatmap and leave notes if they want to write the reason
                    they had low or high tension. </p>

                <h2 id="infoarh">Information Arhitecture</h2>

                <p>During the design phase we created an Information Architecture to showcase what pages our app has and
                    to show how they relate to each other within the system.</p>

            <li class="approach">
                <h2 id="c4">C4 Model</h2>

                <p>The C4 Model is used to visualize the architecture of a software system. The diagram has 4 steps:
                    Context, Container, Component and Code.</p>

                <p>The C4 Model is used to communicate to certain people (stakeholders, programmers) based on each step
                    what the app is and what it contains and it is used to document the different components and their
                    relationship within the system. </p>

                <p>As a team we created the C4 model to communicate our app’s layout to the stakeholder and to show to
                    future students working on this project how the app actually would work.</p>
                <p>Since we did not program the application the last level of the C4 Model was not added.</p>
                <p>I worked on the C1 and C3 because I do not have knowledge of how API and Database work. However after
                    seeing how my teammates worked on C2 model I learned more about it. </p>
