                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                <p>In the sixth semester of Advanced Media Design at Fontys University of Applied Sciences,
                    the student is required to create a portfolio website in which they can showcase all of their
                    work from semester 6.

                    We were asked to consider what kind of IT professional we want to be in the future. My answer is a
                    mix between UI designer and front-end developer. This answer needs to be reflected in the portfolio.
                </p>
            </li>


            <li class="assignment">
                <h2 id="assignment">The Assignment</h2>
                <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                <p>Because there is a lot of workload during the group project, students do not have time to focus on
                    creating from scratch a portfolio. That is why Fontys decided to offer students time to solely focus
                    on creating a beautiful portfolio. <br><br>

                    This will be an individual project that the student will need to finish in 4 weeksâ€™ time. To create
                    the portfolio we need to go through 4 phases: research, design, development and testing. Before
                    starting the project I created a Project Plan that helps me stay organized and plan ahead my goals
                    and the research questions for this project.</p>

            <li class="research">
                <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
                <p>The main research question and the sub-questions I came up with are: <br><br>

                    <span style="color:#FBFF12
                    "> How can I showcase my work to my target audience in a user-friendly way through a
                        portfolio?</span><br>
                    <br>

                    <span style="color: #41EAD4"> 1. What is my target audience and what would they like to see in a
                        portfolio? </span> <br> <br>

                    Due to research I discovered that I have two main users: a company looking for a developer to
                    improve current online products or to create new products like websites or mobile apps. The second
                    user is the Fontys teacher. <br><br>

                    <span style="color: #41EAD4"> 2. What are some of the trends regarding portfolios of UI Designers
                        and Front-end
                        Developers? </span> <br> <br>

                    I discovered many trends when researching but the ones I chose to use are: a prominent profile,
                    simplicity, interactive portfolio and white space between elements. <br> <br>

                    <span style="color: #41EAD4"> 3. What are some of the libraries that can help me add animations to
                        my
                        website? </span> <br> <br>

                    As a result of my research I discovered two JavaScript Libraries that will help me create an
                    interactive and unique portfolio: ScrollReveal.js and Typed.js. <br><br>

                    <span style="color: #41EAD4">4. How can I use GitHub to host the portfolio? </span> <br> <br>

                    I discovered how easy it is to host a website using GitHub and the best part is that it is free!
                    <br><br>

                    The way I conducted my research was answering one by one each sub-question in
                    order. I used mostly secondary research which means I did my research using information already
                    available on the internet. For this project I used multiple research methods from the website
                    [https://www.cmdmethods.nl/](https://www.cmdmethods.nl/). In the end I combined all the research I
                    did for each sub-question to answer the main one. The conclusion and including all the research I
                    did can be found in the Research Document down below.

                <p>In the design phase I created multiple products and research methods to come up with a design for the

            <li class="development">
                <h2 id="development">Development</h2>
                <p>During the development phase, I was able to create my portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript. I used JavaScript Libraries such as <i>Typed.js</i> and <i>ScrollReveal.js</i> to add a
                    more
                    interactive and dynamic feel to my website.

                    In order to make my portfolio available online, I had to answer my fourth research question which
                    was to find out how I can host my portfolio online using GitHub. I did some research and found out
                    that GitHub is a great platform for hosting projects like mine. After completing my coding, I
                    uploaded my code to my GitHub account, making it easily accessible to anyone who wants to see it.

            <li class="testing">
                <h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
                <p>To validate my design of the portfolio I did a quick peer-to-peer review with my classmates at
                    University. I showed them my portfolio to gain some feedback and see what I can change in the future
                    to make it more user-friendly. Many agreed that the design is nice and simple. Some expressed that
                    the auto typing animation is a bit too much and distracting after a while because it is always on
                    the screen when scrolling through the website. A classmate mentioned that the background color is
                    too dark so he prefers a light theme more. Maybe in the future I can add a function for light mode
                    and dark mode.

            <li class="conclusion">
                <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>To conclude, this is the process I went through to create my individual project for the sixth
                    semester of Advanced Media Design. I researched, designed, developed and tested a portfolio website
                    to showcase my group project and international project that will be done this semester. Through this
                    process, I was able to answer the research questions I created and make design decisions that
                    reflect my personal goals as a UI designer and front-end developer. <br> <br> Overall, this project
                    allowed me
                    to improve my skills and learn more about JavaScript libraries, how to host my website using GitHub
                    and create a beautiful and user-friendly portfolio that accurately represents my work and skills.
