                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                <p>In the sixth semester of Advanced Media Design at Fontys University of Applied Sciences,
                    the student is required to create a portfolio website in which they can showcase all of their
                    work from semester 6.

                    We were asked to consider what kind of IT professional we want to be in the future. My answer is a
                    mix between UI designer and front-end developer. This answer needs to be reflected in the portfolio.
                </p>
            </li>


            <li class="assignment">
                <h2 id="assignment">The Assignment</h2>
                <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                <p>Because there is a lot of workload during the group project, students do not have time to focus on
                    creating from scratch a portfolio. That is why Fontys decided to offer students time to solely focus
                    on creating a beautiful portfolio. <br><br>

                    This will be an individual project that the student will need to finish in 4 weeks’ time. To create
                    the portfolio we need to go through 4 phases: research, design, development and testing. Before
                    starting the project I created a Project Plan that helps me stay organized and plan ahead my goals
                    and the research questions for this project.</p>

            <li class="research">
                <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
                <p>The main research question and the sub-questions I came up with are: <br><br>

                    <span style="color:#FBFF12
                    "> How can I showcase my work to my target audience in a user-friendly way through a
                        portfolio?</span><br>
                    <br>




                    <span style="color: #41EAD4"> 1. What is my target audience and what would they like to see in a
                        portfolio? </span> <br> <br>

                    <b>Methodology:</b> Literature Study
                    <br><br>

                    To answer this research question I used the search engine "Google" and used the following key terms:
                    Front-end developer, UI designer, skills, portfolio, IT companies,
                    LinkedIn. <br><br>

                    <b>Conclusion</b> <br> <br>

                    To conclude, my target audience for the portfolio are companies that are
                    looking for front-end developers and UI designers that can design and
                    build websites or mobile apps, proving my hypothesis. Companies
                    generally expect front-end developers to possess a specific set of skills. This
                    information helps me with understanding my target audience’s
                    preferences and needs. From my secondary research I also came up with
                    some suggestions that the portfolio should have so it looks professional
                    and that it could attract employers. The other part of my target audience
                    are teachers that will look at my portfolio and future projects I will be
                    working on. I summarized the requirements that teachers will like to see in
                    the portfolio. <br><br>

                    To answer this research question I used again the search engine "Google" and searched with the
                    following key terms: modern portfolio, minimalistic portfolio, dribble, design trends<br> <br>

                    <b>Conclusion</b> <br> <br>


                    I discovered many cool design trends while doing this
                    research that I got inspired by and it got me excited to start the design
                    phase of the project. By using some of these trends I can leave a good
                    impression on potential clients.
                    As a result of this research, I am now up to date with the latest trends in
                    portfolio design, which I can use to make my design more attractive and
                    engaging to my target audience. <br> <br>

                    To answer this research question I used again the search engine "Google" and searched with the
                    following key terms: JavaScript libraries, animation libraries, best JavaScript
                    animation libraries.<br> <br>


                    <br> <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>

                    To conclude, I discovered which JavaScript libraries are the most
                    recommended. I found out what each can library can do to enhance the
                    user-experience of a website. To answer the research question: "What are
                    some of the libraries that can help me add animations to my website?" I
                    have decided which libraries will be the most useful for my portfolio. When
                    choosing a library, I considered several key factors such as its difficulty of
                    use, its capabilities, and where I can use it in my existing design portfolio. <br> <br>


                    As a result of my research I discovered two JavaScript Libraries that will help me create an
                    interactive and unique portfolio: ScrollReveal.js and Typed.js. <br><br>

                    <span style="color: #41EAD4">4. How can I use GitHub to host the portfolio? </span> <br> <br>

                    I discovered how easy it is to host a website using GitHub and the best part is that it is free!
                    <br><br>

                    The reason for choosing Github is that my previous portfolio was hosted using the service from
                    Fontys called "Hera". But since it is
                    owned by Fontys, once I graduate I cannot host my portfolio on it anymore and loose my credientials
                    once my student account will be deleted.
                    Github was the best choice since it was the easiest, not time consuming and it is for free.

            <li class="development">
                <h2 id="development">Development</h2>
                <p>During the development phase, I was able to create my portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript. I used JavaScript Libraries such as <i>Typed.js</i> and <i>ScrollReveal.js</i> to add a
                    more
                    interactive and dynamic feel to my website.

                    In order to make my portfolio available online, I had to answer my fourth research question which
                    was to find out how I can host my portfolio online using GitHub. I did some research and found out
                    that GitHub is a great platform for hosting projects like mine. After completing my coding, I
                    uploaded my code to my GitHub account, making it easily accessible to anyone who wants to see it.

                <p>Test type: peer-to peer review <br>
                    Location: Fontys Strijp TQ <br>
                    Participants: 3 students <br> <br>
                    To validate my design of the portfolio I did a quick peer-to-peer review with my classmates at
                    University. I showed them my portfolio to gain some feedback and see what I can change in the future
                    to make it more user-friendly. Many agreed that the design is nice and simple. Some expressed that
                    the auto typing animation is a bit too much and distracting after a while because it is always on
                    the screen when scrolling through the website. A classmate mentioned that the background color is
                    too dark so he prefers a light theme more. Maybe in the future I can add a function for light mode
                    and dark mode. <br> <br>

                    <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>

                    In conclusion, the testing phase helped me gather useful feedback that can help improve the
                    portfolio this semester but also what i can do better in the next future portfolio. For this
                    portfolio I will change the font size to a smaller one according to the feedback so it is more
                    readable and easy on the eye. <br>

                <p>To conclude, this is the process I went through to create my individual project for the sixth
                    semester of Advanced Media Design. I researched, designed, developed and tested a portfolio website
                    to showcase my group project and international project that will be done this semester. Through this
                    process, I was able to answer the research questions I created and make design decisions that
                    reflect my personal goals as a UI designer and front-end developer. <br> <br> Overall, this project
                    allowed me
                    to improve my skills and learn more about JavaScript libraries, how to host my website using GitHub
                    and create a beautiful and user-friendly portfolio that accurately represents my work and skills.
