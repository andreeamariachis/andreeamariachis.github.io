                <p>During the research phase we concentrate on the empathize step of design thinking. The target
                    audience of our group project are people with PPS (Physical Persistent Symptoms). To better
                    understand our target audience each one of us conducted literature study.</p>

                    symptoms (MUPS), daily life, wearables.</p>

                <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
                <p>In conclusion, Persistent Physical Symptoms (PPS), also known as Medically Unexplained Symptoms
                    (MUS), is a condition characterized by long-term physical symptoms without identifiable medical
                    causes. This literature review explores PPS across various medical fields and highlights the impact
                    it has on individuals' physical and psychological well-being.</p>
                <p>The studies found that many older adults with depression often experience physical symptoms like
                    vague aches, fatigue, and digestive problems. These symptoms can be linked to underlying psychiatric
                    issues. The severity of depression is related to the frequency of physical complaints. Older adults
                    with generalized anxiety disorder also tend to have frequent physical symptoms. Patients with
                    persistent unexplained physical symptoms face disability and often have other mental health
                    problems.</p>

                <p>It's important for healthcare providers to recognize and address these physical complaints, as they
                    can significantly impact a patient's quality of life and healthcare costs. Patients with unexplained
                    symptoms may have their own explanations and fears, and they value being listened to and understood
                    by their healthcare providers.</p>

                <p>
                    In the future, wearable devices may offer a solution to help individuals with anxiety and
                    depression. These devices can monitor moods and behaviors, providing a way for individuals to track
                    and manage their stress levels.
                    Overall, this study highlights the need for a holistic approach that considers both physical and
                    mental well-being when caring for patients with persistent physical symptoms.</p>

                <h2 id="secondaryResearch">Secondary Field Research</h2>
                <p><b>Method: Secondary Field Research</b></p>

                <p>Goal :After understanding what PPS is, we started field research on our Target Audience to deepen our
                    understanding of our users, to know theirs needs, desires and pain points. </p>

                <p>We received from two external research team members, Jesse and Fenne (Fontys Paramedical students)
                    interviews that had participants suffering from PPS. Their scope was different than ours but we
                    chose to analyze their interview because the clinic that initially planned to connect us with our
                    target uses was at full capacity, due to other student researchers. Any interviews that provide
                    insights about our target group, was valuable, which is why we translated and analysed their
                    interviews. </p>

                <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
                <p>Participants' pain points include chronic muscle tension and pain, which worsen after experiencing
                    stress. They want to understand the reasons behind their pain, showing that they need a stress
                    application that could show potential stressors.

                    Participants are interested in monitoring their heart rate and stress levels, wanting an overview of
                    their stress throughout the day. They also want to understand how different activities affect their
                    stress levels and receive alerts when stress is high.</p>
                <p>Each one of us had an interview to analyze. The following document contains the transcript and
                    summary of the interview I analysed.</p>

                    project.
                </p>

                <p>The interviews were conducted with the participant’s consent to record, ensuring accurate capturing
                    of their insights. We interviewed 7 people in total.</p>

                <p>Each one of us participated in the interviews, having different roles each time like speaker,
                    observer and note taker. I was the interviewer in one interview that I also made a transcript for
                    and analysed it. </p>

                <p>After our interviews, we gathered more information about our target users, their needs, pain points
                    and struggles. When asked, the participants desire in a stress app features like personalized
                    relaxation sounds, integration with calendars, reaching out for support, easy-to-understand data
                    visualizations, stress journaling, and notifications. </p>

                <p>Following the insights from research, a user requirement list was made to serve as a planning tool

                </p>

                <p>1. A baseline establishment: user's average stress level</p>
                <p>2.Real-time stress level visualization</p>
                <p>3.Display stress levels in relation to different activities</p>
                <p>4.Allow users to track their stress levels over an extended period and view trends</p>
                <p>5.Visualize stress data throughout the day in an easy-to-understand format</p>
                <p>6.Integrate HRV measurements for a more comprehensive stress analysis</p>
                <p>7.Incorporate additional data points such as sleep patterns and activities</p>

                <p>After having made these requirements, user stories were made :</p>

                <p>1.As a user, I want the system to establish a baseline stress level for me, allowing me to compare my
                    current stress levels to my individual normal range and track my progress in managing stress.</p>
                <p>2.As a user, I want the system to visualize the measured stress level in real-time so that I can be

                <p>3.As a user, I want the system to display how different activities affect my stress levels, so I can
                    identify activities that contribute to stress</p>
                <p>4.As a user, I want to track my stress levels over an extended period of time and view trends, so
                    that
                    I can gain insights into my overall stress patterns and identify any long-term changes or trends

                <p>The MOSCOW technique categorizes requirements into four distinct categories: Must-have, Should-have,

                    essential features are addressed first while allowing flexibility for additional functionalities.
                    When applied to the development of a data visualization application for people with PPS, the MOSCOW
                    analysis becomes an invaluable tool for understanding and prioritizing the needs of users. At first,
