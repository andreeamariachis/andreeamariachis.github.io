                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                <p>To validate our designs, we conducted an AB testing with the first prototype we created. AB testing
                    is a method used to compare two versions of a webpage or app to determine which one performs better
                    in terms of user engagement or based on user requirements. </p>

                <p><b>CMD Method: AB Testing</b></p>


            </li>


            <li class="context">
                <h2 id="process">Process</h2>

                <p>Each one of us conducted an AB testing with different users via a survey or online and in person.
                </p>


                <p>My testing was conducted online and I showed to the participant all the designs one by one while
                    encouraging the user talk out loud and see if he understands or not the graphs we created. In the
                    end the participant had to choose the designs that made the most sense to him.</p>

                <p>We gathered very good feedback from our participants that can be used in the iteration of our next
                    prototype. </p>





            </li>


            <li class="approach">
                <h2 id="sketches">Results from my AB testing</h2>

                <p>This is some of the feedback on the first Overview Page of our prototype given by participant 3:</p>

                <p>The participant understood that the first graph shows real time data of tension level. But was
                    confused by the “mm” term. He likes the “Incoming” feature that shows him his next event taken from
                    his calendar.
                    The participant was not sure what 60% efficiency means. He expects he can get more
                    information if he presses on the card to go to the Sleep Page.
                    The participant expressed confusion when looking at the clock graph since it did not have accurate
                    data and no explanation for what each color means.</p>








            <li class="approach">
                <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

                <p>In conclusion, the feedback from participants highlights the importance of clarity, meaningful
                    explanations, intuitive design, and the provision of additional information for a better
                    understanding of the data visualizations. Incorporating these suggestions can enhance the user
                    experience and make the screens more informative and user-friendly.</p>

                <p>All our findings and feedback from the Testing Phase can be found in the following document:</p>
